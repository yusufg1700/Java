    whem you create a class you will use it to create an object most probably, java knows it
    because of that when you create a class java puts "consturtor" in it automatically, its name is "defauilt constructor

    Ä±f you create your own constructor, java delete the "default constructor"

    //how to create consturcor
    //Constructor name must match with the class name
    //what is the difference between "constructors" and "methods"
    // constructors don't have return type but methods have
    //constructor name must match with the class name but method name can be any name
    //constructors are used to create object but methods are used to create same actions
    // if any class you want to use is in the same packet no need to import
    //but if the class is ,n the different package you have you import it
